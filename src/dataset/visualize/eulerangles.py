Euler's rotation theorem tells us that any rotation in 3D can be
described by 3 angles.  Let's call the 3 angles the *Euler angle vector*
and call the angles in the vector :math:`alpha`, :math:`beta` and
:math:`gamma`.  The vector is [ :math:`alpha`,
:math:`beta`. :math:`gamma` ] and, in this description, the order of the
parameters specifies the order in which the rotations occur (so the
rotation corresponding to :math:`alpha` is applied first).
In order to specify the meaning of an *Euler angle vector* we need to
specify the axes around which each of the rotations corresponding to
:math:`alpha`, :math:`beta` and :math:`gamma` will occur.
There are therefore three axes for the rotations :math:`alpha`,
:math:`beta` and :math:`gamma`; let's call them :math:`i` :math:`j`,
:math:`k`.
Let us express the rotation :math:`alpha` around axis `i` as a 3 by 3
rotation matrix `A`.  Similarly :math:`beta` around `j` becomes 3 x 3
matrix `B` and :math:`gamma` around `k` becomes matrix `G`.  Then the
whole rotation expressed by the Euler angle vector [ :math:`alpha`,
:math:`beta`. :math:`gamma` ], `R` is given by::
   R = np.dot(G, np.dot(B, A))
See http://mathworld.wolfram.com/EulerAngles.html
The order :math:`G B A` expresses the fact that the rotations are
performed in the order of the vector (:math:`alpha` around axis `i` =
`A` first).
To convert a given Euler angle vector to a meaningful rotation, and a
rotation matrix, we need to define:
* the axes `i`, `j`, `k`
* whether a rotation matrix should be applied on the left of a vector to
  be transformed (vectors are column vectors) or on the right (vectors
  are row vectors).
* whether the rotations move the axes as they are applied (intrinsic
  rotations) - compared the situation where the axes stay fixed and the
  vectors move within the axis frame (extrinsic)
* the handedness of the coordinate system
See: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotation_matrix#Ambiguities
We are using the following conventions:
* axes `i`, `j`, `k` are the `z`, `y`, and `x` axes respectively.  Thus
  an Euler angle vector [ :math:`alpha`, :math:`beta`. :math:`gamma` ]
  in our convention implies a :math:`alpha` radian rotation around the
  `z` axis, followed by a :math:`beta` rotation around the `y` axis,
  followed by a :math:`gamma` rotation around the `x` axis.
* the rotation matrix applies on the left, to column vectors on the
  right, so if `R` is the rotation matrix, and `v` is a 3 x N matrix
  with N column vectors, the transformed vector set `vdash` is given by
  ``vdash = np.dot(R, v)``.
* extrinsic rotations - the axes are fixed, and do not move with the
  rotations.
* a right-handed coordinate system
The convention of rotation around ``z``, followed by rotation around
``y``, followed by rotation around ``x``, is known (confusingly) as
"xyz", pitch-roll-yaw, Cardan angles, or Tait-Bryan angles.

    """ Return matrix for rotations around z, y and x axes
    Uses the z, then y, then x convention above
    Parameters
    ----------
    z : scalar
       Rotation angle in radians around z-axis (performed first)
    y : scalar
       Rotation angle in radians around y-axis
    x : scalar
       Rotation angle in radians around x-axis (performed last)
    Returns
    -------
    M : array shape (3,3)
       Rotation matrix giving same rotation as for given angles
    Examples
    --------
    >>> zrot = 1.3 # radians
    >>> yrot = -0.1
    >>> xrot = 0.2
    >>> M = euler2mat(zrot, yrot, xrot)
    >>> M.shape == (3, 3)
    True
    The output rotation matrix is equal to the composition of the
    individual rotations
    >>> M1 = euler2mat(zrot)
    >>> M2 = euler2mat(0, yrot)
    >>> M3 = euler2mat(0, 0, xrot)
    >>> composed_M = np.dot(M3, np.dot(M2, M1))
    >>> np.allclose(M, composed_M)
    True
    You can specify rotations by named arguments
    >>> np.all(M3 == euler2mat(x=xrot))
    True
    When applying M to a vector, the vector should column vector to the
    right of M.  If the right hand side is a 2D array rather than a
    vector, then each column of the 2D array represents a vector.
    >>> vec = np.array([1, 0, 0]).reshape((3,1))
    >>> v2 = np.dot(M, vec)
    >>> vecs = np.array([[1, 0, 0],[0, 1, 0]]).T # giving 3x2 array
    >>> vecs2 = np.dot(M, vecs)
    Rotations are counter-clockwise.
    >>> zred = np.dot(euler2mat(z=np.pi/2), np.eye(3))
    >>> np.allclose(zred, [[0, -1, 0],[1, 0, 0], [0, 0, 1]])
    True
    >>> yred = np.dot(euler2mat(y=np.pi/2), np.eye(3))
    >>> np.allclose(yred, [[0, 0, 1],[0, 1, 0], [-1, 0, 0]])
    True
    >>> xred = np.dot(euler2mat(x=np.pi/2), np.eye(3))
    >>> np.allclose(xred, [[1, 0, 0],[0, 0, -1], [0, 1, 0]])
    True
    Notes
    -----
    The direction of rotation is given by the right-hand rule (orient
    the thumb of the right hand along the axis around which the rotation
    occurs, with the end of the thumb at the positive end of the axis;
    curl your fingers; the direction your fingers curl is the direction
    of rotation).  Therefore, the rotations are counterclockwise if
    looking along the axis of rotation from positive to negative.
